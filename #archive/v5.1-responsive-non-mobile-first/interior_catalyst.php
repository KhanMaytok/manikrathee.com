								<h2>Minimal &amp; Beautiful</h2>
							</div>
							<p>CATALYST is a minimal iOS Theme designed specifically for the iPhone 4’s Retina Display. Having always been a fan of minimalistic design, and also being a fan of tech customization, it was just a matter of time before I took my design skills and focused them towards iOS and UI design. CATALYST was my first, and arguably most successful, attempt at any UI design on iOS.</p>

								<h2>The Spec</h2>
							</div>
							<p>CATALYST is for the iPhone 4 but it can be used on older generation iPhones, iPods as well as iPads. All native apps are skinned as well as a large number of third-party apps. It also includes a weather widget and calendar widget, both displayed on the offical website. (Click "View Project" on the right to see it.) Along with Apple sanctioned apps, Cydia and some of its most popular downloads are skinned.</p>

								<h4>The Apps you know &amp; love</h3>
								<p>The Apple iPhone is known for its fantastic form factor, amazing operating systems and, most of all, the incredible library of apps that we have come to love. CATALYST covers hundreds of these applications and has more added constantly. From productivity apps like OmniFocus, to music streaming apps like Rdio and Pandora, to social apps like Facebook, Twitter and Google+ - everything you know and love can fall within the gorgeous &amp; minimalistic umbrella of CATALYST.</p>
