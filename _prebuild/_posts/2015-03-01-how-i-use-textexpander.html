<p>I have used a long list of code editors over the years, ranging from notepad on windows to Espresso on mac, to textmate and Sublime Text. Ultimately, SublimeText 2 came out in front because it is so simple to use and so exceptionally customizable.</p>

<p>With a field as broad as development, every individual's personal preferences can yeild varying effects on speed and productivity. I research quite a bit about improving my workflow and have built my SublimeText preference file up to be a pretty solid starting point for most people.</p>
