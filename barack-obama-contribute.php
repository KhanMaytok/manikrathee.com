						<p>Hope Will See Us Through is a side project I started early this year. I was listening to a song, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Bayside/Killing+Time/It%27s+Not+A+Bad+Little+War" title="It's Not A Bad Little War by Bayside" target="_blank">Its Not A Bad Little War by Bayside</a>, for what must have been the thousandth time. At some point in the breakdown, I realized that I had listened to it over and over, but I had never actually <em>heard</em> it.</p>
					
						<p>It was at this moment that I chose the very next line and decided to create a typographic blog dedicated to bringing lyrics to life. And so, HOPE was born.</p>

						<p>I originally intended to create a new piece every week. This plan quickly changed because I realized that just picking a line in a song and making a piece out of it wasn’t what I really wanted.</p>
					
						<p>I wanted to take music that meant something to me and really feel it. Take a line that could send shudders down your spine and make it immortal.</p>
					
						<p>This is why my updates have become erratic. I won’t update just for the sake of updating. I’ll update when a song strikes me and I will listen to that song for hours while I sketch. At some point,  lyrics work their way into the sketches and thats when they make their way onto the screen.</p>
