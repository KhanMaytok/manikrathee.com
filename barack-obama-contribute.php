			<h4>Innovating for the Commander-In-Chief</h4>
			
		<div class="inner-container">
			
			<p>We had a tough problem to solve. We had the support of a massive network of grassroots supporters giving between $5 and $50 when asked, but that wasn’t enough. We needed to make online donations easier, faster and more accessible.</p>

			<p>We needed to take more risks.</p>

			<p>The first question that came to my mind was: ‘How do we innovate on a fundraising platform that, because of the 2008 campaign, was already perceived as successful?’</p>

			<h5>ESTABLISHING A BASIS</h5>

			<p>We had starting information in the form of best practices and early-stage testing to validate our hypothesis but we had to decide whether we could run larger changes and estimate gains/losses based on this data. We didn’t have time to continue testing every little change. We had to be smarter and faster &mdash; we had to couple changes together and read the data in a more comprehensive way.</p>

			<p>The standard web-form had not been drastically changed in years. People have tried modifying basic inputs and styles but the results have either been impossible to use or a step-back visually. </p>

			<p>We needed to figure out a way to improve it and reduce the barrier of entry for all users. This was a unique challenge because our target audience could vary from a young supporter that works on computers for a living to a 48 year-old mother of two that is a partner at a law firm. Being able to build a single experience that can both excite any type of user &amp; allow them to easily fill out the form is not an easy thing to accomplish.</p>

			<p>We did, however, have a great advantage: an un-ending audience to run a/b tests on and a fresh flow of volunteers for user research.</p>

			<p>So, we started taking larger, smarter risks.</p>
